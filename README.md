## EZ-Autostart

EZ-Autostart is a application that abuses the android launcher feature to launch a app of your choice via a preconfigured package name. example use cases are auto launching some app on embedded devices or locking a user in a specific app(dont forget to disable settings then ;) ). The app isn't licensed, do anything you want with it. There may be things that you could do better idk, i threw this app together in 10 minutes(writing this readme literally took longer then writing the app itself). There is no root required and in THEORY it should run anywhere from android 5 to android 12.

### Usage 
- install the app
- open the app and enter the package name of the app you want to auto launch
- set the app as the default launcher
- you are done, every time the device restarts or a user tries to go to the homescreen he gets thrown back into the app
